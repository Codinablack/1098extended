What is this?
=============

I'm releasing this just in case someone is interested into working with new items/sprites while using latest TFS 1.X and 10.98 client (or OTC),
AND don't want to use other project files, since this one I made is UNMODIFIED, works with latest RME
and SHOULD be compatible with future TFS updates in case they do so (OTX/OTBR users wont be the same IDs)


How To Use
=============

- !!!ALWAYS BACKUP EVERYTHING!!!
- (Assuming you already have your TFS set up and RME installed)
- Download everything from this repository
- Extract Cibia.rar to your 10.98 client folder and rename them
- Open your RME/data/clients.xml search for the 10.98 entry and change it to <data format="10.57" dat="0x4A10" spr="0x59E48E02"/>
- Now go into your RME/data/1098 and replace the items.otb and items.xml with the one downloaded here
- Go to your TFS/data/items replace the items.otb and items.xml with the one downloaded here
- Go to your TFS/data/XML and replace the outfits.xml and mounts.xml  with the one downloaded here

Done, now you can start your server and client and enjoy all latest sprites,
if you wanna check the IDs use RME, because right now the items have no name.
